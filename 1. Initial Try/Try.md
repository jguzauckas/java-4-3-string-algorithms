# Initial Try

In `Try.java`, there is an incomplete `for` loop trying to print out each character of the `String` `str`.

Complete the `for` loop so that it successfully prints each of the letters.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
