# You Do

Use the knowledge from the standard algorithms in the notes to finish the `divisibleNumbers` and `nonDivisibleNumbers` methods.

The goal of the `divisibleNumbers` method is that given a positive integer value, it prints each whole integer value that divides the provided number, if any. i.e. `divisibleNumbers(15)` would print out `1`, `3`, `5`, and `15`, and `divisibleNumbers(24)` would print out `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `6`, `8`, `12`, and `24`.

The goal of the `nonDivisibleNumbers` method is that given a positive integer value, it prints each whole integer value that does not divide the provided number and is less than the provided number, if any. i.e. `nonDivisibleNumbers(8)` would print out `3`, `5`, `6`, and `7`, and `nonDivisibleNumbers(11)` would print out `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`, and `10`.

Both of these methods are `void` and should not use `return`, only printing!

Note that there are pre-loaded tests in the main method. When done correctly, the file should run and print the expected answers.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
