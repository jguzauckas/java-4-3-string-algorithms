# Understanding Check

Use the knowledge from the standard algorithms in the notes to finish the `numDigits` and `sumDigits` methods.

The goal of the `numDigits` method is that given a positive integer value, it returns the number of digits in that number. i.e. `numDigits(15)` would return `2`, `numDigits(1234)` would return `4`, and `numDigits(123456)` would return `6`.

The goal of the `sumDigits` method is that given a positive integer value, it returns the sum of the digits in that number. i.e. `sumDigits(15)` would return `6`, `sumDigits(1234)` would return `10`, and `sumDigits(123456)` would return `21`.

Note that there are pre-loaded tests in the main method. When done correctly, the file should run and print the expected answers.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
